"Just ship it. We'll figure out if people want it later."

That was me, three years ago. Full of confidence. Full of shit.

I was leading product at a growing SaaS company. We had customers, revenue, momentum. And we were drowning in feature requests.

Slack messages. Email threads. Support tickets. A spreadsheet with hundreds of rows nobody looked at.

Every week: "What should we build next?"

Every week: whoever shouted loudest won.

## The Breaking Point

We spent four months building a complex analytics dashboard. Beautiful UI. Elegant architecture. I was proud of it.

Launch day: 6 people used it. Six.

I remember that post-mortem meeting. Turns out, exactly ONE customer had asked for this feature. And we'd convinced ourselves it was what "everyone" wanted.

That's when it hit me: we were making massive bets based on vibes.

## The Spreadsheet Hell

I tried to fix it:

- Built a Notion database (abandoned after 3 weeks)
- Tried Airtable (team hated it)
- Spreadsheets (nobody updated them)
- Voting tools (customers ignored them)

The problem wasn't the tool. Everything was scattered:

Feature requests in tickets. Feedback in Slack. Votes in people's heads. Roadmap decisions in hallways.

No signal. Just noise.

## The Call That Changed Everything

Six months ago, a founder told me:

> "I have 200 customers telling me what they want. And I have NO IDEA which features would actually move the needle. So I just... build whatever feels right and hope."

I saw myself in her. I saw thousands of founders and PMs—all stuck in the same trap.

That's when I knew I had to build something different.

## Why I'm Building Plaudera

Not because the world needs another SaaS tool.

But because I lived this pain. And thousands of product people are living it right now.

Feature requests shouldn't die in Slack. Roadmap decisions should be data-driven, not gut-driven. Teams deserve clarity, not spreadsheet hell.

## What I've Learned

Building Plaudera has been humbling. I'm still figuring it out. Still learning.

But I know this: the best products are built by listening to customers, not guessing what they want.

If I can help even a handful of teams stop wasting months on features nobody asked for?

That's worth it.

## To Every Founder Reading This

If you've ever built something nobody wanted, felt overwhelmed by feature requests, or made a roadmap decision you weren't confident in...

You're not alone. I've been there.
