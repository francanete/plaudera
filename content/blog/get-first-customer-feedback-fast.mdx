You signed up for Plaudera. You have a feedback board ready to go. Now what?

Here's how to get your very first piece of customer feedback — in about 5 minutes.

## Step 1: Share Your Board Link

Every Plaudera workspace comes with a public board URL. It looks something like:

```
your-company.plaudera.com
```

You can find it in your [Board Settings](/dashboard/board). Copy the link and share it:

- **Drop it in Slack** — paste it in your customer-facing channel
- **Add it to your app** — link to it from your help menu or settings page
- **Send it directly** — email it to 3-5 customers you talk to regularly

That's it. Anyone with the link can submit ideas and vote on existing ones — no account required.

## Step 2: Embed the Feedback Widget

Want feedback without sending people to a separate page? Embed the Plaudera widget directly in your app.

Head to [Board Settings](/dashboard/board) and grab your embed snippet. Paste it into your app and a small feedback button will appear in the corner — your users can submit ideas without leaving your product.

You can customize the widget position, colors, and which pages it appears on from your dashboard.

## Step 3: Ask Your First Customers

The fastest way to get feedback is to ask for it. Here's a message template you can send right now:

> Hey [Name], I'm collecting feature ideas for [Product]. If there's anything you wish it could do, I'd love to hear it: [your board URL]

Send that to 3-5 customers. You'll likely have your first submissions within hours.

## What Happens Next

Once feedback starts coming in, Plaudera helps you make sense of it:

- **Votes** surface what matters most to your users
- **AI duplicate detection** automatically groups similar requests
- **Public roadmap** lets customers see what you're working on

You don't need hundreds of submissions to get value. Even 5-10 ideas from real customers will show you patterns you didn't expect.

## Start Now

The best time to start collecting feedback was yesterday. The second best time is right now.

[Go to your dashboard](/dashboard) and share your board link with one customer. That's all it takes.
