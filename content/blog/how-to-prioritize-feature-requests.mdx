## The Problem

You're drowning in feature requests.

Every customer wants something different. Your Slack is full of "quick ideas." Support tickets are piling up. Your team is building features back-to-back, but nobody seems happy.

Sound familiar?

Here's what most founders get wrong: **they think the problem is not having enough requests**.

The real problem? **You have too many, and no system to make sense of them.**

## Why Traditional Prioritization Fails

Most teams try one of these approaches:

### 1. The "Loudest Customer Wins" Method

The person who complains the most gets their feature built. Problem: They're often not your ideal customer.

### 2. The Spreadsheet Graveyard

Every request goes into a massive spreadsheet that nobody looks at. Six months later, you realize you've been ignoring your most-requested feature.

### 3. The Gut Feeling Approach

"This feels important" becomes your entire strategy. Spoiler: Your gut is often wrong.

### 4. The RICE/ICE Framework Overload

You spend more time scoring features than actually building them. Analysis paralysis kicks in.

## A Better Way to Prioritize Feature Requests

Here's what actually works (learned the hard way):

### Step 1: Centralize Everything

**Stop using Slack, email, support tickets, and Twitter DMs as your "roadmap."**

Pick ONE place where all feedback lives:

- Could be a [feature request board](/blog/why-your-product-needs-feature-request-board) (like Plaudera, Canny, or ProductBoard)
- Could be a dedicated Notion database
- Could even be a well-organized Airtable base

The key: **every request gets logged in the same place.**

### Step 2: Group Similar Requests

This is the game-changer most teams skip.

Ten people asking for "better notifications" in different ways is NOT ten separate feature requests — it's ONE feature with high demand.

**How to do this:**

- Tag requests with categories/themes
- Look for common language patterns
- Group by underlying problem, not exact wording

Pro tip: AI can help with this. Instead of manually reading 100 requests, let AI surface the patterns. (This is exactly why we built [Plaudera's AI insights](https://plaudera.com/#features) — it groups similar requests automatically.)

### Step 3: Segment by Customer Type

Not all feedback is equal.

A request from a paying customer who's on your highest tier? High priority.

A request from someone on a free trial who hasn't converted yet? Lower priority.

**Segment by:**

- Plan type (free vs. paid vs. enterprise)
- Customer LTV (lifetime value)
- User role (decision-maker vs. end-user)
- Industry (if relevant to your product strategy)

### Step 4: Use a Simple Scoring System

Forget complex frameworks. Use three simple questions:

**1. How many customers want this?**

- 50+ requests = High demand
- 10-50 requests = Medium
- <10 requests = Low

**2. Does it align with our vision?**

- Yes = Keep
- No = Reject (even if popular)
- Maybe = Revisit later

**3. Can we build it this quarter?**

- Yes = Prioritize
- No = Backlog

That's it. Don't overthink it.

### Step 5: Review Weekly, Decide Monthly

**Weekly:** Review new requests, group similar ones, tag by customer type.

**Monthly:** Make roadmap decisions based on your scoring.

**Why this cadence?**

- Weekly keeps you close to customer needs
- Monthly gives you space to build without constant pivots

## Common Prioritization Mistakes (And How to Avoid Them)

### Mistake 1: Building Everything

**Fix:** Learn to say no. Your roadmap should have 3-5 major features per quarter, not 50.

### Mistake 2: Ignoring Small Improvements

**Fix:** Reserve 20% of your time for quick wins. They keep customers happy while you build the big stuff.

### Mistake 3: Never Sharing Your Roadmap

**Fix:** Make it public. Customers stop asking "when will X be ready?" when they can see it's on [your roadmap](/blog/complete-guide-public-roadmap-tools-2026). ([Here's ours](https://feedback.plaudera.com/roadmap) as an example.)

### Mistake 4: Prioritizing Based on Who Asks Last

**Fix:** Use your system. Don't let recency bias dictate your roadmap.

### Mistake 5: Building Features Nobody Uses

**Fix:** After launch, track usage. If nobody uses it, kill it and move on.

## The Real Secret: Close the Feedback Loop

Here's what separates great product teams from mediocre ones:

**They tell customers what happened to their feedback.**

When you prioritize a feature:

- Tag the requesters
- Let them know it's coming
- Invite them to beta test

When you reject a feature:

- Explain WHY (vision misalignment, low demand, technical constraints)
- Offer an alternative if possible

**This does two things:**

1. Customers feel heard (even when you say no)
2. You build trust and loyalty

## How We Built Plaudera to Solve This

After years of drowning in scattered feedback, I built [Plaudera](https://plaudera.com) to handle this exact problem.

**What it does:**

- **Centralizes feedback** from everywhere (support, email, [embeddable widgets](https://plaudera.com/#features))
- **Uses AI to group similar requests** automatically (no more manual deduplication)
- **Lets you segment by customer type** (paid vs. free, plan tier, etc.)
- **Makes roadmap prioritization visual** with a simple [public board](https://feedback.plaudera.com)
- **Closes the loop** with automatic notifications when features ship

**Why we kept it simple:**
No RICE scoring. No complex workflows. Just the essentials: collect, organize, prioritize, ship.

If you're tired of feature request chaos, [try Plaudera](https://plaudera.com/pricing). Start free, upgrade when you need more. But honestly, the principles above work with any tool (or even a well-organized spreadsheet).

## TL;DR: The Prioritization Framework

1. **Centralize** - One place for all feedback
2. **Group** - Similar requests = one feature
3. **Segment** - Weight by customer value
4. **Score** - Demand + vision + feasibility
5. **Review** - Weekly updates, monthly decisions
6. **Close the loop** - Tell customers what happened

**The goal isn't to build everything.**

The goal is to build the right things for the right customers at the right time.

And to do that, you need a system — not just a gut feeling.
