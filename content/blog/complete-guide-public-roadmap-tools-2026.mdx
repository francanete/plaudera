## Why Keeping Your Roadmap Secret Is Killing Trust

Every week, you get the same questions:

"When will feature X be ready?"
"Are you working on Y?"
"What's coming next?"

You answer them individually. It takes hours. And next week, new customers ask the exact same questions.

**There's a better way: make your roadmap public.**

Sounds scary? I get it. But here's what happens when you do:

- Customers stop asking repetitive questions
- You build trust through transparency
- [Feature requests](/blog/why-your-product-needs-feature-request-board) align because people see what's already planned
- Your team stays accountable (in a good way)

**A public roadmap tool makes this effortless.**

## What Is a Public Roadmap Tool?

A public roadmap tool is software that lets you:

- Show what you're building (now, next, later)
- Display progress on features
- Accept feedback and votes from customers
- Keep everyone aligned on priorities

**Think of it as your product strategy, made visible.**

Unlike internal tools (Jira, Asana, Linear for your team), a public roadmap is customer-facing. It's designed for clarity, not complexity.

## Why Public Roadmaps Work (Even If You Think They Don't)

### "Won't competitors steal our ideas?"

Short answer: No.

Long answer: Ideas are cheap. Execution is everything. By the time a competitor copies your roadmap, you've already shipped it. Plus, they have access to your product anyway — they can see what you're building.

**What you gain > what you risk.**

### "What if we can't deliver on time?"

Here's the secret: **don't promise timelines.**

Public roadmaps show _what_ you're working on, not _when_ it'll be ready. Use status labels like:

- Exploring
- Planned
- In Progress
- Shipped

No dates = no broken promises. ([Here's how we do it on Plaudera's roadmap](https://feedback.plaudera.com/roadmap).)

### "Our roadmap changes constantly. Won't this confuse people?"

That's exactly why you need it public. When priorities shift, you explain why. Customers respect honesty.

Example:

> "We deprioritized dark mode to focus on mobile app performance based on your feedback. 73% of you said speed matters more."

Clear communication > keeping secrets and disappointing people later.

## What Makes a Great Public Roadmap Tool?

Not all roadmap tools are created equal. Here's what separates the best from the rest:

### Essential Features

**1. Simple Status System**
Good: Now / Next / Later
Better: Exploring / Planned / In Progress / Shipped
Overkill: 15 different stages that confuse everyone

**2. Easy to Update**
If updating your roadmap takes 20 minutes, you won't do it. Find a tool that syncs with your project management workflow or is dead simple to update manually.

**3. Customer-Friendly Design**
Your roadmap should be readable by non-technical users. If it looks like Jira, you've lost 80% of your audience.

**4. Voting/Feedback Integration**
Let customers upvote what they care about. Bonus points if it connects to your [feature request system](/blog/why-your-product-needs-feature-request-board).

**5. Changelog Connection**
When you ship something, automatically move it to "Shipped" and notify everyone who voted or commented. Close the loop.

### Nice-to-Haves (But Not Critical)

**1. Embed Anywhere**
Some tools let you embed the roadmap on your site, in your app, or in documentation. Convenient, but not essential.

**2. Private vs. Public Toggle**
Useful if you have enterprise customers who need early visibility on features under NDA.

**3. Analytics**
Track which features get the most views/votes. Interesting, but most teams don't use this data effectively.

**4. Custom Branding**
Makes it feel like your product, not a third-party tool. Nice for polish, not critical for function.

## How to Choose the Right Public Roadmap Tool

**If no:** Start with something standalone (Plaudera, Canny, or even Notion).

### 2. What's your team size?

## How to Launch Your Public Roadmap (Step-by-Step)

### Step 1: Pick Your Tool

Use the guide above. **Start simple.** You can always upgrade later.

### Step 2: Structure Your Roadmap

Use a simple 3-column format:

**Now:** What you're actively building (1-3 items)
**Next:** What's planned for this quarter (3-5 items)
**Later:** Ideas you're considering (5-10 items)

Don't overwhelm people with 50 features. Focus on clarity.

### Step 3: Seed It With Current Work

Don't launch an empty roadmap. Add:

- What you're building right now
- What you've recently shipped (to show momentum)
- Top-voted feature requests from customers

### Step 4: Make It Easy to Find

Add the roadmap link to:

- Your website navigation ("Roadmap")
- Your app's help menu
- Email signatures
- Support replies

**Make it part of every customer touchpoint.**

### Step 5: Set Update Expectations

Pick a cadence and stick to it:

- **Weekly:** Update progress on "In Progress" items
- **Monthly:** Review "Next" column, add new items
- **Quarterly:** Major roadmap refresh

**Tell customers how often you'll update.** It sets expectations.

### Step 6: Announce It

When you launch:

- Blog post: "We're making our roadmap public. Here's why."
- Email to customers: "See what we're building next."
- Social media: "Transparency FTW. Check out our public roadmap."

**Make it a moment.** Public roadmaps are a statement about your company culture.

## Common Public Roadmap Mistakes (And How to Avoid Them)

### Mistake 1: Overcommitting on Timelines

**Fix:** Use "Now/Next/Later" instead of dates. If you must give dates, say "Q3 2026" not "August 15."

### Mistake 2: Never Updating It

**Fix:** Set a recurring calendar reminder. If the roadmap goes stale, it's worse than having none.

### Mistake 3: Putting Everything on "Later"

**Fix:** Be honest about what you won't build. "Not Planned" is a valid status.

### Mistake 4: Forgetting to Celebrate Shipped Features

**Fix:** When you ship something, move it to "Shipped" and notify people who voted. Make shipping visible.

### Mistake 5: Making It Too Complex

**Fix:** If you need a user guide to read your roadmap, simplify it. ([Read our prioritization framework](/blog/how-to-prioritize-feature-requests) for more on keeping things simple.)

## Real-World Example: Building in Public with Plaudera

When we built [Plaudera](https://plaudera.com), we made our [roadmap public](https://feedback.plaudera.com/roadmap) from day one.

**Why?** Because we're building a tool about transparency — we had to practice what we preach.

**What we learned:**

1. **Customers appreciate honesty.** When we said "this feature is on hold because we're prioritizing mobile performance," people got it.

2. **Public accountability is motivating.** Seeing "In Progress" items on the roadmap kept our team focused.

3. **It filters the right customers.** People who want features we're not building self-select out. Saves everyone time.

4. **Transparency builds trust faster than marketing.** Our roadmap converts better than our landing page.

We built Plaudera to be the public roadmap tool we wished existed: simple, affordable, and connected to [feedback collection](https://plaudera.com/#features). No enterprise bloat, no $500/month plans, and AI that actually helps (not just buzzwords).

**If you want a roadmap that just works,** [try Plaudera free](https://plaudera.com/pricing). But the principles above work with any tool — even a free Notion page.
