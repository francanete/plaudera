## The Hidden Cost of Private Feature Requests

Here's a pattern I see constantly:

A customer emails asking for a feature. You say "we'll consider it" and add it to your internal backlog. Three months later, five more customers ask for the exact same thing. You finally build it. Everyone's frustrated it took so long.

**The problem?** Nobody knew others wanted it too.

This is what happens when feature requests live in private channels — support tickets, email threads, Slack DMs. Every request feels like a one-off because you can't see the pattern.

**A public feature request board changes everything.**

## What Is a Feature Request Board?

Think of it as a transparent roadmap where:

- Customers submit ideas
- Others vote on what they want most
- You respond publicly to show you're listening
- Everyone sees what's being worked on

**Popular examples:**

- Canny, ProductBoard, Frill (the enterprise options)
- Linear's public roadmaps
- GitHub Issues (for technical products)
- [Plaudera's feedback boards](https://feedback.plaudera.com) (simple, affordable option)

But here's the thing: you don't need enterprise software. You need a system that fits your stage and workflow.

## Why Public Feature Request Boards Work

### 1. Customers Stop Asking "When Will X Be Ready?"

Instead of answering the same question 50 times, you point them to the board:

> "Great idea! We already have it on the roadmap. You can track progress here: [link]"

Instant trust boost. They feel heard without you promising a timeline.

### 2. Validation Happens Automatically

When multiple customers upvote the same feature, you know it's not just one loud person. It's real demand.

**Example:**

- 1 person asks for dark mode = "interesting"
- 50 people upvote dark mode = "build this next quarter"

The board does the market research for you. (This is exactly how we [prioritize features at Plaudera](/blog/how-to-prioritize-feature-requests) — votes + customer segment + vision alignment.)

### 3. You Build Community, Not Just Features

Customers who see their ideas acknowledged (even if rejected) stick around longer. They become advocates.

**Why?** They feel like they're part of the journey, not just paying for a product.

### 4. It Forces You to Say No (Publicly)

This sounds scary but it's powerful. When you mark something as "Won't Build" with a clear explanation:

- Sets expectations
- Shows you have a strategy
- Prevents scope creep

Saying no publicly is harder than saying no privately. But it makes your vision clearer.

## What Makes a Good Feature Request Board?

Not all boards are created equal. Here's what separates good from great:

### Do This:

**1. Make Submissions Easy**

- [Embeddable widget](https://plaudera.com/#features) on your site
- Single-click submission from your app
- Email integration (so support tickets auto-create requests)

**2. Allow Voting, Not Just Comments**

- Comments = noise. Votes = signal.
- 100 upvotes > 100 comments saying "+1"

**3. Show Status Clearly**

- Under Review
- Planned
- In Progress
- Shipped
- Won't Build (with reasons)

**4. Close the Loop**

- When you ship something, notify everyone who voted
- When you reject something, explain why

**5. Keep It Simple**

- Customers shouldn't need instructions to use it
- You shouldn't need a PhD to manage it

### Avoid This:

**1. Making It Too Complex**

- RICE scoring visible to customers? Confusing.
- 15 different tags? Overwhelming.
- Keep it simple: idea → votes → status.

**2. Never Responding**

- A public board with no updates is worse than no board at all
- Commit to weekly reviews minimum

**3. Promising Timelines You Can't Keep**

- "Coming next month!" → 6 months later = trust destroyed
- Better: "On the roadmap, no ETA yet"

**4. Letting It Replace Direct Feedback**

- The board is for visibility, not for deep customer conversations
- Still do user interviews and direct calls

## Types of Feature Request Boards (And When to Use Each)

### 1. The Simple Public Roadmap

**What it is:** A page showing what you're building, what's next, and what's done.

**Best for:** Early-stage products, technical audiences

**Tools:** Notion (public page), Linear (public roadmaps), even a simple webpage

**Pros:** Zero setup, easy to maintain
**Cons:** No voting, no community input

### 2. The Voting Board

**What it is:** Customers submit ideas, others vote, you prioritize by votes + strategy.

**Best for:** Growing SaaS products with active users

**Tools:** Canny, ProductBoard, Frill, [Plaudera](https://plaudera.com)

**Pros:** Clear demand signals, community engagement
**Cons:** Needs moderation and regular updates

### 3. The GitHub Issues Model

**What it is:** Technical users submit detailed feature requests with specs.

**Best for:** Developer tools, open-source projects, technical products

**Tools:** GitHub Issues, GitLab Issues

**Pros:** Developer-friendly, built into workflow
**Cons:** Too technical for non-technical users

### 4. The Hybrid Approach

**What it is:** Public roadmap + private feedback collection + selective visibility.

**Best for:** B2B SaaS with enterprise customers who need privacy

**Tools:** ProductBoard (with privacy controls), custom solutions

**Pros:** Flexibility
**Cons:** More complex to manage

## How to Launch Your First Feature Request Board

### Step 1: Pick Your Tool (Don't Overthink It)

**Starting out (0-100 customers)?**
→ Notion public page or Linear public roadmap (free, simple)

**Growing (100-1K customers)?**
→ Dedicated board like [Plaudera](https://plaudera.com), Canny, or Frill

**Enterprise (1K+ customers)?**
→ ProductBoard or custom solution

**The best board is the one you'll actually update.** Start simple.

### Step 2: Seed It With Existing Requests

Don't launch with an empty board. Add:

- Top 10-15 requests from support tickets
- Features you're already planning
- A few "Shipped" items to show you deliver

**Why?** Customers are more likely to engage when they see activity.

### Step 3: Make It Easy to Find

Place it:

- In your app (Help menu → "Request a feature")
- On your website footer ("Roadmap")
- In support replies ("See what's coming: [link]")

### Step 4: Commit to a Review Cadence

**Weekly:** Review new submissions, respond to questions
**Monthly:** Update statuses, announce shipped features

**If you can't commit to this, don't launch the board.** Stale boards kill trust.

## Common Mistakes (And How to Avoid Them)

### Mistake 1: Building Everything That Gets Votes

**Fix:** Votes inform decisions, they don't make decisions. Your vision comes first. ([Read our prioritization framework](/blog/how-to-prioritize-feature-requests) for more on this.)

### Mistake 2: Letting the Board Become a Support Channel

**Fix:** Redirect bug reports and support questions elsewhere. The board is for _ideas_, not _problems_.

### Mistake 3: Forgetting to Close the Loop

**Fix:** When you ship something, celebrate it on the board. Tag voters, share a changelog, make it a win.

### Mistake 4: Hiding Behind "We'll Consider It"

**Fix:** Be honest. Say "Yes, this is planned" or "No, here's why" or "We're unsure — here's what would change our mind."

### Mistake 5: Never Saying No

**Fix:** Rejection is part of good product strategy. If everything is "under review," nothing is.

## Real Example: How We Use a Feature Request Board for Plaudera

When we built [Plaudera](https://plaudera.com), we knew we needed this for ourselves (classic dogfooding).

**Our approach:**

- [Public board](https://feedback.plaudera.com) embedded on the site
- Customers submit ideas in seconds via the widget
- AI groups similar requests (so "notifications" and "email alerts" become one feature)
- We review weekly, update statuses publicly
- When we ship, everyone who voted gets notified

**The result?**

- Less time answering "can you build X?" emails
- Clearer roadmap driven by real demand
- Customers who feel heard (even when we say no)

We kept it simple on purpose. No complex workflows, no enterprise features you'll never use. Just collect, organize, prioritize, ship.

If you want a board that works out of the box, [try Plaudera free](https://plaudera.com/pricing). But the principles above work with any tool.
