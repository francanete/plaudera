"We need dark mode."

"Can you add a night theme?"

"The app is too bright—black background please?"

"Dark UI would be awesome."

Four requests. One feature. If your feedback board treats these as separate items, you've got a duplicate problem—and it's costing you more than you think.

## The Hidden Cost of Duplicate Feedback

Duplicates seem like a minor annoyance. They're not. Here's what they actually cost your team:

### Vote Splitting

Your users want dark mode. But instead of 47 votes on one request, you have:

- "Dark mode" — 18 votes
- "Night theme" — 12 votes
- "Dark UI option" — 9 votes
- "Black background" — 8 votes

None of these hit your "top 10" list individually. The feature that would actually win gets buried because votes are scattered across duplicates.

### Roadmap Confusion

Your PM looks at the feedback board and sees dark mode mentioned... somewhere. Is it a priority? The data says "maybe." In reality, it's your #1 most-requested feature hiding in plain sight.

### Wasted Engineering Time

Worst case? You build the feature twice. One engineer implements "night mode" while another builds "dark theme settings" because nobody realized they're the same thing.

### User Frustration

Users search for "dark mode," don't find it, and create a new request. Now you have five duplicate posts. Users who submitted the original feel ignored. Everyone loses.

## Why Duplicates Happen in the First Place

Understanding the problem helps solve it. Duplicates appear because:

**Different words, same idea**: "Export to CSV" vs "Download spreadsheet" vs "Excel export" all mean the same thing to users.

**Multiple channels**: The same feature gets requested via support tickets, in-app feedback, sales calls, and your public board—each logged separately.

**Time gaps**: Someone requested "mobile app" two years ago. A new user requests it today without finding the old post.

**Specificity differences**: "Better search" and "search should support filters" are related but not identical. Are they duplicates? It depends.

**Language barriers**: Non-native speakers describe features differently. "Make notifications less" vs "notification preferences" vs "do not disturb mode."

## Manual Deduplication: A Step-by-Step Process

If you're handling duplicates manually, here's a systematic approach:

### Step 1: Establish Naming Conventions

Create a standard format for feature requests:

**Good**: `[Category] Feature name - Brief description`

- `[UI] Dark mode - System-wide dark color theme`
- `[Export] CSV download - Export data as spreadsheet`

**Bad**: Whatever users type

- `can u add dark mode plz`
- `THE APP IS TOO BRIGHT`

You can't control what users submit, but you _can_ rename and categorize posts after the fact.

### Step 2: Regular Duplicate Audits

Schedule weekly or bi-weekly "duplicate sweeps":

1. Sort requests by newest first
2. Search for keywords from each new request
3. Check for similar existing requests
4. Merge or link related posts

This takes 30-60 minutes per week depending on feedback volume.

### Step 3: Create Merge Policies

Define clear rules for what counts as a duplicate:

**Merge when**:

- Requests describe the identical feature in different words
- One request is a subset of another (specific → general)
- The implementation would be the same regardless of wording

**Keep separate when**:

- Requests have different use cases, even if related
- One is a feature, the other is a bug report
- Implementation would actually differ

### Step 4: Communicate Merges

When you merge duplicates, notify affected users:

> "Hi [Name], we merged your request 'night theme' with our existing 'dark mode' request. Your vote has been transferred, and you'll receive updates as this feature progresses. Thanks for the feedback!"

This closes the loop and shows users their input matters.

## AI-Assisted Deduplication: The Modern Approach

Manual deduplication doesn't scale. Once you're getting 10+ requests per day, you need automation.

### How AI Duplicate Detection Works

Modern AI-powered tools (like Plaudera) use semantic similarity to catch duplicates:

1. **Embedding generation**: Each request gets converted into a numerical representation capturing its meaning—not just keywords
2. **Similarity comparison**: New requests are compared against existing ones
3. **Threshold matching**: If similarity exceeds a threshold (typically 55-70%), the system flags a potential duplicate
4. **Human review**: You approve or reject the merge suggestion

The key insight: AI understands that "dark mode" and "night theme" mean the same thing, even though they share zero words.

### AI vs. Keyword Matching

Traditional tools use keyword matching. They'd catch "dark mode" and "dark mode please" but miss "night theme" entirely.

AI catches semantic duplicates that keyword matching never would:

| Request A        | Request B              | Keyword Match? | AI Match? |
| ---------------- | ---------------------- | -------------- | --------- |
| "Dark mode"      | "Night theme"          | No             | Yes       |
| "Export to PDF"  | "Download as PDF file" | Partial        | Yes       |
| "Faster loading" | "App is slow"          | No             | Yes       |
| "Mobile app"     | "iPhone version"       | No             | Yes       |

### The Best Workflow: AI + Human Review

Don't let AI merge automatically (at least not at first). The ideal workflow:

1. **AI suggests**: System flags "Night theme" as a potential duplicate of "Dark mode"
2. **Human reviews**: You verify it's actually a duplicate
3. **One-click merge**: Approve the merge, consolidate votes automatically
4. **User notification**: System notifies affected users

This combines AI speed with human judgment. Over time, as you trust the system, you can increase automation.

## Merge Best Practices

### When to Merge

**Do merge**:

- Identical features described differently
- Specific requests that fit under a broader feature
- Old requests that got resubmitted

**Don't merge**:

- Related but distinct features (keep them linked instead)
- Bug reports with feature requests
- Requests for different platforms (iOS vs Android)

### Preserving Context

When merging, preserve valuable context from both requests:

- **Consolidate votes**: All voters from both posts should count
- **Keep comments**: Merge comment threads or link to the original
- **Note the merge**: Add an internal note explaining what was combined

### Handling Edge Cases

**Partial overlaps**: Request A wants "dark mode." Request B wants "dark mode + custom accent colors." These aren't quite duplicates. Options:

1. Keep separate and link them
2. Merge into "Theme customization" with dark mode as first milestone
3. Implement dark mode and keep custom colors as a follow-up

**Feature vs. bug**: "App crashes in dark mode" isn't a duplicate of "add dark mode"—it's a bug report. Keep these separate.

**Platform-specific**: "Dark mode on iOS" vs "Dark mode on Android" might be one feature or two, depending on your architecture.

## Creating a Duplicate Handling Policy

Document your approach so your whole team handles duplicates consistently:

---

### Sample Policy: Duplicate Feature Request Guidelines

**Definition**: A duplicate is a feature request that describes the same functionality as an existing request, regardless of wording.

**Detection**:

- AI flags potential duplicates automatically
- Team reviews suggestions within 24 hours
- Weekly manual audit catches anything AI missed

**Merge criteria**:

- Implementation would be identical
- User intent is the same
- One request doesn't add meaningful scope beyond the other

**Keep separate when**:

- Different use cases require different implementations
- Platform-specific considerations apply
- One is significantly broader in scope

**Merge process**:

1. Review AI suggestion or identify duplicate manually
2. Consolidate votes to the older/better-titled request
3. Update title/description if the newer request had better framing
4. Send notification to affected voters
5. Add internal note documenting the merge

**Responsibility**: Product team reviews duplicates; support team flags suspected duplicates they notice.

## Tools That Handle Duplicates Well

Not all feedback tools treat duplicates seriously. Here's what to look for:

**AI-powered detection**: Catches semantic duplicates, not just keyword matches. Plaudera and Canny both offer this.

**Merge with vote consolidation**: Votes should transfer automatically. Some tools make you do this manually (painful at scale).

**Merge history**: You should be able to see what was merged and undo if needed.

**User notifications**: Automated emails to affected users when their request gets merged.

**Suggestion queue**: A dedicated view for reviewing potential duplicates, not scattered alerts.

## The ROI of Good Duplicate Management

Let's put numbers to this:

**Without duplicate detection**:

- 500 feature requests, ~30% are duplicates (150 duplicates)
- 2 hours/week manual auditing = 104 hours/year
- Vote splitting hides your top 3 most-requested features
- You build one feature twice (let's say 2 dev weeks wasted)

**With AI duplicate detection**:

- 150 duplicates auto-flagged, 5 minutes each to review = 12.5 hours/year
- Clear priority data because votes consolidate automatically
- Zero duplicate features built

**Time saved**: 90+ hours/year
**Better decisions**: Priceless

## Getting Started

If duplicate feedback is already a problem, here's your action plan:

### Week 1: Audit

Go through your existing requests. Identify obvious duplicates. Merge them manually to establish a clean baseline.

### Week 2: Policy

Document your duplicate handling policy (use our template above). Share with your team.

### Week 3: Tooling

If you're still on spreadsheets or a tool without duplicate detection, consider switching. The time savings compound quickly.

### Ongoing: Review

Whether AI-assisted or manual, make duplicate review part of your weekly routine. 15 minutes prevents hours of confusion later.
